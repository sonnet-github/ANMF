@inherits Umbraco.Web.Mvc.UmbracoViewPage
@{ Layout = null; }
@Umbraco.RenderTemplate(Model.Id)
@*
This template has been created for the sole purpose of stopping rendering errors
from bubbling into the backoffice, when caching content for FullTextSearch.

For some reason, when doing _umbracoComponentRenderer.RenderTemplate() as a part
of an event in Umbraco, YSODs bubble through to the backoffice, with no error
message, leaving the user with no clue about what happened. The user can be led
believe that the Save&Publish failed - but it didn't. The node just couldn't be
rendered for some reason, most likely a bug in the nodes template.

Please keep this template as it is - if you delete it, it will get re-created the
next time something needs to be cached for indexing with Full Text Search.

Thank you for your understanding. And remember; if you like FullTextSearch,
you can always buy me a virtual coffee at https://github.com/sponsors/skttl
